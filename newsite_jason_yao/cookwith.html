          <p>
            60% of millenials use digital recipes to cook. However, there is a high chance that the non-pros fail when trying a new dish even with recipes.
            As cooking with recipes can be unorganized and intrusive, this frequently replaced the joyful experience of cooking with stress.

                Thus, for different cooking methods in the recipe, timers, alarm clocks, and reminders will be used accordingly.
                Timers and alarms will notify users when the task is done to avoid overcooking.
                For the last category, as it is not time-sensitive and is safe to set it aside when it is done, it doesn't need to use an alarm to notify its completion.
                The reminders will remind users of certain actions to be taken to the ongoing tasks from the 2nd category in multitasking.

                As I want to balance guiding people with the steps and offering flexibility for people to use, I think this system should be tailored to cooking methods as different cooking methods have different characteristics.
                <br><br>
                I divided the cooking methods into 4 categories according to the attention required in cooking.
                The first one requires constant attention while cooking.
                The other 3 categories don't require constant attention, and they are the opportunity for multitasking.
                The 2nd and 3rd categories require people's attention when they are done.
                The difference is that the 2nd requires some attention in the middle.
                Like people need to stir the noodle when it is boiling.

          <p>People are not machines.
            In cooking, one step may take longer, while others may take a shorter amount of time.
            Thus, when multitasking in cooking, the timer may run out earlier or later than planned in the recipe.
            Cookwith allows users to adjust the order of the steps in the recipe on the go in an intuitive way.

                  This recipe requires boiling noodles.
                  The noodles are supposed to be drained as soon as it is boiled.
                  So these two steps are linked,  as the completion of the former is the latter's precondition, and the latter should be executed as soon as the completion of the former.

                  However, from the usability testing, this timer is a crucial checkpoint for people lacking cooking experience.
                  It is the most concrete way for them to know that the food is ready, compared with terms like "change of color of the meat."
                  So we added another type of timer as shown in the updated screen.

                  When designing the instruction screen in step-by-step mode, we split the ingredients and the action.
                  We have two major variants of displaying:
                <ol>
                  <li>Using bullet points with colors/formats related to the corresponding ingredient as distinguishers.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Using PNG images of ingredients and put this list on top of the instructions.    </li>
                </ol>
                  <br>
                  From A/B testings, people prefer the first variant, but bullet points are less intuitive than the PNG images.
                  So the new iteration combines the two variants.

                <b>Designing for AR</b>
                <br>
                With the presented solutions, the user still needs to jump between real kitchen space and the digital recipes.
                To solve this problem, we thought the best way is to utilize the emergent technology.
                We picked three technologies with related products in the market, gesture control, audio control, and Augmented Reality (AR).

                <br>
                <br>
                After comparison, AR is the best tool to solve this problem. So the next step for us would be designing the experience with 3D user interfaces in an AR environment and utilize the physical space to close the communication gap.

          <p>What I found very helpful in research is documenting our observation sessions.
            All the details were contained in journey maps with images showing the details.
            It helped the team be on the same page and helped the stakeholders understand the context quickly in meetings.
            <br>
            <br>
            Another takeaway of mine is about system thinking in design.
            When designing the interaction within a system, it is crucial to understand the existing interaction and relationships among all the system elements.
            I found it was conducive to identifying problems when I  keep them in mind in observations and research.
            As a result, the system should be broken down and assembled again with new interactions uniting the system elements.
