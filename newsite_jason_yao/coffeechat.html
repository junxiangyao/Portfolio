                  <p>The user needs to pick the date and time from the consultants available times to schedule a video call sessioin. To reduce the steps to go through for booking, the challenge is visualizing the availability in a limited screen real estate.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Inspired by Google Calendar, my solution is, in one page, asking users to choose the duration, then to pick an ideal period of time, and to pick the start time of the call at the end. The iterations of this screen are shown on the right.

                  As the goal of the app is to bring the coffee chats to a digital format, it is important to tell users the consulting fees are at the price of cups of coffee. In addition, from the testing and critique sessions, I learned that showing this price strategy is effective to encourage new users to tryout this app. Thus, I used coffee cup icons to represent numeric price to keep the focus on experience and knowledge sharing, instead of money and profit.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The current solution is shown on the right. However, I am still looking for a better solution. I think more user testing sessions on this feature will bring insights about the directions to refine the current solution.

          <p>In my design, I have several hypotheses:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Users prefer to see price shown as cups of coffee as CoffeeChat is trying to digitalize the coffee chats between students and professionals, which is not viable under pandemic.</li>
              <li>The information about consultants presented in each card and the profile page is enough. However, I will still try refining it by adding and removing content.</li>
            </ol>
          <p>
            To test the hypothesis, I will conduct another round of user test with a higher fidelity of the prototype. Because Figma doesn't have code components, it cannot save the states of the prototype. For instance, it cannot really remember if the user had already booked a call with a specific consultant. I think this interferes with the testing results because the participants are not really regarding this prototype as realistic once they find out only several buttons in the prototype are clickable. They tend to rely on the indicators presented by Figma when they are not sure where to tap. I could use tools like Framer X to build a prototype with higher fidelity that can remember the state of the prototype.
