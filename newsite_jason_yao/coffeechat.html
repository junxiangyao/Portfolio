                  there are two types of services, charged and free.

                  <br>
                  The charged ones are charging users high prices
                  (Like in MentorCruise, a 30-min introductory call can cost from $39 to $100)
                  with more standardized services.
                  As for the free ones like UX Coffee Hours, professionals join as volunteer consultants to give back to the community.
                  However, the coverage of current services is limited for the reasons shown in the table.

                  In general, the price of the charged ones is kind of high for students.
                  In MentorCruise, a 30-min introductory call can cost from $39 to $100.
                  It also asks more commitment from mentors, which will stop professionals to sign up.

                  <br>
                  As for the free ones, like UX Coffee Hours,  there are only a finite number of slots available, and they can be booked out fast.
                  And it didn't provide enough icentives to moitvate more professionals investing more time.

                  As a result, the coverage of current services is limited.

                  <br><br>
                  From my market research, all the services that tries to tackle this problem are based on video chatting for its accessibility.
                  However, for the free ones, the slots can be booked out really fast;
                  and for the charged ones, there is no alternative ways of consulting that is more affordable for students.
                  Thus, to increase the flexibility and accessibility, CoffeeChat allows students to send consultants questions as text-based consultation.

                  I first sketched out the low fedelity wireframes on paper, and then used Figma to create mid-fidelity wireframes accordingly.
                  Next, I used these wireframes to make a clickable mid-fidelity prototype in Figma for user testing.

                  I tested the mid-fidelity prototype with 6 participants.
                  Then, I used Miro to debrief these testing sessions and sort them into themes.
                  Next, I used the Rainbow Spreadsheet and Jakob Nielson's usability scale to measure the intensity of the usability issues.

                  This is the major testing session that tested all the main features.
                    After making changes according to the result, I did multiple rounds of iterations with more task-based testing, A/B testing, and card sorting to validate ideas and assumptions.

                    The challenge is visualizing the availability in a limited screen real estate.
                    <br><br>
                    Inspired by Google Calendar, my solution is to ask users to choose the duration, pick an ideal slot, and pick the start time of the call at the end.
                    From A/B testing, I learned that users prefer this one over the pattern Calendarly is using, because CoffeeChat is more straightforward and all the tasks can be done in one page.

                    In the early phases, the coffee cup is considered only a representation of the numeric price to downplay this service's transactional aspect.
                    So users will need to memorize the exchanging ratio.
                    <!-- Though in the testing sessions with students, participants found it acceptable but not intuitive enough. -->
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <!-- Attempts to remind users of the monetary value of the cups: -->

                    From the testing sessions with professionals, I realized that I need to go deeper to design a complete token system and think more about viability.

                  <br><br>
                    Thus, in the new token system, coffee cup tokens became an independent payment method instead of a euphemism of the numeric price.
                    As users don't have to memorize the cup's monetary value anymore, the interaction became more intuitive.
                  <!-- This is how a problem of UI and interaction is solved by designing the system. -->

                    When I tested it with students, the star rating system seems fine.
                    <!-- as it helps students to choose professionals to work with. -->
                    However, I realized that the consultation session from professionals' goodwill shouldn't be rated with stars from the testing with professionals.
                    <!-- The real coffee chats shouldn't be rated this way either. -->
                    So I redesigned the feedback system as thumb-ups and optional text-based feedback that could be sent privately to the consultants at the end of each session.

                To measure the effectiveness of the design decisions made in this project, here are 4 metrics that should be tracked:

                <ol>
                  <li>  The number of consultations students booked and the number of cups they used per month.</li>
                  <li>  The average time students take to spend their first coffee cup tokens for call-booking.</li>
                  <li>  The ratio of question-based consultation to video sessions and how it changes over time.</li>
                  <li>  The average ratio of slots paid with tokens to the ones paid with money and how it changes over time.</li>

              <p>
                <b>Classification of Consultations</b>
                <br>
                The UX patterns of different types of consultation should be different.
                More research on different types of consultation (e.g., CV Feedback, Work Review, Interview Preparation) is needed to understand both students and professionals' mental models.
                <!-- Also, the research of this project focused on students major in design and engineering.
                More research is needed to study students from other fields. -->
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Other Formats of Consultations</b>
                <br>
                For now, CoffeeChat focuses on one-time consultation only.
                It should also include other types consultation, like long-term mentorship and career coachings.
                <!-- two other ways students use to receive career advice. -->
                <!-- The payment pattern and how the tokens are used will be different from the current strategy. -->
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Detailed Plan for Question-Based Consultation </b>
                <br>
                The current question-based consultation can only be sent to one consultant and be paid with one token.
                More testing sessions are needed to determine the ideal mechanism for consultants answering those questions.
                <!-- like the pricing policy and the number of slots for answering questions. -->
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>App for Consultants</b>
                <br>
                Because this project aims to design the student's side of CoffeeChat app first,
                the next step is to figure out the consultant's side of it.
                More research is needed to understand their motivations and concerns about helping students and joining CoffeeChat.

          <p>This project helped me learn the process of end-to-end product design and understand why system thinking is crucial in experience design.
            When designing a platform containing both service providers and receivers, it is important to include both sides of users in designing the system.
            Even though I can only start with one side of the platform, I need to understand other users to make decisions.
            Design decisions and features for one side are usually decided by the need and preference of the other side.
