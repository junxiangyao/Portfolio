                I studied how the current market solves this problem.
                There are two types of services, charged and free.
                <br>
                <br>
                In general, the price of the charged ones is kind of high for students.
                In MentorCruise, a 30-min introductory call can cost from $39 to $100.
                <br>
                <br>
                As for the free ones, like UX Coffee Hours,  there are only a finite number of spots available, and they can be booked out fast.
                As a result, the coverage of current services is limited.

                To facilitate the process students consulting professionals, CoffeeChat uses video chat and text-based questions as the consulting channels.
                <br><br>
                From my market research, all the services that tries to tackle this problem are based on video chatting for its accessibility.
                However, for the free ones, the slots can be booked out really fast;
                and for the charged ones, there is no alternative ways of consulting that is more affordable for students.
                Thus, to increase the flexibility and accessibility, CoffeeChat allows students to send consultants questions as text-based consultation.

                To attract professional to become consultants at CoffeeChat, incentives are important, as the professionals don’t have to use a platform to find mentees.
                <!-- supply < demand & good will -->
                Thus, consultants in this platform should be paid.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, not all students are willing to pay a lot for this type of service and not all professionals came to CoffeeChat for money.
                To facilitate and encourage coffee chats which comes from people’s good will, a flexible payment system is implemented with coffee cups as tokens.

  							In synthesizing the data, I used miro to debrief all the test sessions on the virtual sticky notes in miro, and the sort them into themes based on four categories: observations, positive quotes, negative quotes, and errors. Next, I used Jakob Nielson’s usability scale to measure the intensity of the errors from 0 to 4, with 4 being a catastrophic usability issue.

                  As the goal of the app is to bring the coffee chats to a digital format, it is important to tell users the consulting fees are at the price of cups of coffee. In addition, from the testing and critique sessions, I learned that showing this price strategy is effective to encourage new users to tryout this app. Thus, I used coffee cup icons to represent numeric price to keep the focus on experience and knowledge sharing, instead of money and profit.

          <p>In my design, I have several hypotheses:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Users prefer to see price shown as cups of coffee as CoffeeChat is trying to digitalize the coffee chats between students and professionals, which is not viable under pandemic.</li>
              <li>The information about consultants presented in each card and the profile page is enough. However, I will still try refining it by adding and removing content.</li>
            </ol>
          <p>
            To test the hypothesis, I will conduct another round of user test with a higher fidelity of the prototype. Because Figma doesn't have code components, it cannot save the states of the prototype. For instance, it cannot really remember if the user had already booked a call with a specific consultant. I think this interferes with the testing results because the participants are not really regarding this prototype as realistic once they find out only several buttons in the prototype are clickable. They tend to rely on the indicators presented by Figma when they are not sure where to tap. I could use tools like Framer X to build a prototype with higher fidelity that can remember the state of the prototype.
