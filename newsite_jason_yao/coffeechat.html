                  with more standardized services.
                  As for the free ones like UX Coffee Hours, professionals join as volunteer consultants to give back to the community.

                  In general, the price of the charged ones is kind of high for students.
                  In MentorCruise, a 30-min introductory call can cost from $39 to $100.
                  It also asks more commitment from mentors, which will stop professionals to sign up.

                  <br>
                  As for the free ones, like UX Coffee Hours,  there are only a finite number of slots available, and they can be booked out fast.
                  And it didn't provide enough icentives to moitvate more professionals investing more time.

                  As a result, the coverage of current services is limited.

                  From my market research, all the services that tries to tackle this problem are based on video chatting for its accessibility.

                  and for the charged ones, there is no alternative ways of consulting that is more affordable for students.

                  <br><br>

                  For consultants, coffee cups can be transferred to real money.  Along with displaying the number of cups they have received, this token could serve as <b>an incentive to motivate professionals</b> to sign up and invest their time in CoffeeChat.
                  <br><br>
                  The strategy is to <b>cultivate trust</b> by providing flexibility, making the charged consultation more acceptable to students. As they know what they are paying for, they are more likely to purchase the high-priced services.

                    In the early phases, the coffee cup is considered <b>only a euphemism</b> of the price to downplay this service's transactional aspect.
                    So users will need to memorize or check the exchanging ratio while booking.
                    <!-- Though in the testing sessions with students, participants found it acceptable but not intuitive enough. -->

                  <!-- Attempts to remind users of the monetary value of the cups: -->

                    From the testing sessions with professionals, I realized that I need to design a token system and think more about viability.
                    Thus, in the new token system, coffee cup tokens became <b>an independent payment method</b>.
                    As users don't have to memorize the cup's monetary value anymore, the interaction became more intuitive.
                  <!-- This is how a problem of UI and interaction is solved by designing the system. -->

                    When I tested it with students, the star rating system seems fine.
                    <!-- as it helps students to choose professionals to work with. -->
                    However, I realized that the consultations from professionals' <b>goodwill</b> shouldn't be <b>rated with stars</b> from the testing with professionals.
                    <!-- The real coffee chats shouldn't be rated this way either. -->
                    So I redesigned the feedback system as thumb-ups and optional text-based feedback that could be sent privately to the consultants at the end of each session.

                <b>Classification of Consultations</b>
                <br>
                Different types of consultation should have different UX patterns.
                More research on different contents (e.g. CV Feedback, Interview Preparation) is needed to understand users' mental models.
                <!-- Also, the research of this project focused on students major in design and engineering.
                More research is needed to study students from other fields. -->

              <p>
                <b>Other Types of Consultations</b>
                <br>
                For now, CoffeeChat focuses on one-time consultation only.
                It should also include other types, like long-term mentorship and career coachings.
                <!-- two other ways students use to receive career advice. -->
                <!-- The payment pattern and how the tokens are used will be different from the current strategy. -->
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Detailed Plan for Question-Based Consultation </b>
                <br>
                More testing sessions are needed to determine the ideal mechanism for consultants answering those questions, including the edge cases.
                <!-- like the pricing policy and the number of slots for answering questions. -->
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>App for Consultants</b>
                <br>
                Because this project focuses on the student's side first,
                the next step is to figure out the consultant's side.
                I will research more to understand their motivations and concerns about helping students and joining CoffeeChat.

          <p>This project helped me learn the process of end-to-end product design and understand why system thinking is crucial in experience design.
            When designing a platform containing both service providers and receivers, it is important to include both sides of users in designing the system.
            Even though I can only start with one side of the platform, I need to understand other users to make decisions.
            Design decisions and features for one side are usually decided by the need and preference of the other side.
