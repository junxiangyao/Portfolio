                  <h3>  a multidisciplinary UX/Product Designer specializing in interaction design, system thinking, and coding. </h3>
              <p>


                <!-- Hi, I am . I'm an interaction designer and creative coder based in San Francisco.
                I believe human-centered design is the answer to utilizing technology in the most empathetic way.
                In return, technology is a critical reinforcement that enhances the interaction between humans and their life.
                I aim to increase people's well-being in designing interaction systematically. -->

                I have been a designer all my life. Started from Industrial Design, I then studied and practiced creating digital interactive experiences for more than 5 years.
                Now, I am able to work independently in all phases of product design, including research, strategy, ideating, prototyping, testing, and coding.


                <br>
                <br>



                Currently, I'm working on redesigning and upgrading The Programming Foundation's website and learning platform.
                I focus on designing engaging learning experiences and helping spread coding literacy to unprivileged group, as I believe human-centered design is the answer to utilizing technology in the most empathetic and systematic way.

                <!-- While I was pursuing the master's design in interaction design -->
                Throughout 2020, I worked with The Children's Creativity Museum as a UX/UI Design Consultant working on creating a mobile portal to engage their current count of 10,000+ children and create a new revenue stream.
                I had the chance to serve as the design team's project manager and guided the team to navigate through the pandemic.


                <!-- Prior to this, I helped CivicMakers redesign newsletters for their 3700+ subscribers to increase their communication effectiveness. -->



                <!-- Throughout my journey, I have been a part of internships, freelance projects and volunteer work as a UX and UI designer.
                It has always been an added advantage that I can code. So you can call me a coder who designs or a designer who codes.
                Currently, I am volunteering with two non profits who are low on funds but need design solutions.
                I am happy to help them with that for I understand the impact design can create. -->
                <!-- <br>
                <br>

                I enjoy hunting out root causes and hidden problems in the process of research and design.
                Thus, reading history books and papers is another hobby of mine due to the same reason: I want to dig out the factors about why things happened the way they did and understand how we are who we are today. -->

                <br>
                Prior to this, while pursuing my first Master's Degree from UC Santa Barbara, I worked on creating immersive interactive experience and information visualizations at The Experimental Visualization Lab as I am passionate about emergent interactive media.
                So, in my spare time, you can find me playing with code, headset, data, and browsers and exploring interaction possibilities in VR/AR/MR.
